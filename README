=======================

interaction with L4 inner system calls.

The current state of this module is reflected
by consulting manual pages for L4Env::Dice:

QUICK INSTALL (for the impatients)

1. cp include/template_config.h to include/config.h

2. perl Makefile.PL INC=-I./include LIB=/some/dst POLLUTE=1  
   make;  
   ... 
   make install;

3. write my_perl_lib.pl:

	#!/usr/bin/perl -w
	use MyCompiler::Blurb;

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

	Currenty, i'm only considering only dice or idl4 ans thus an L4 
	implementation as raw basic requirements. 

	This module does not assert any particularities about the
	resulting (L4) interfaces, and thus doesn't give any particular
	hints on those user-defined facilities.  

WARNING

	This code is experimental! We expect the user
	full responsability over his own use and we dont gives
	any garants over an expected rationale.. In others words,
	you're on our own if expect something out of it.  
	For everything else, I wish yourself having fun hacking on L4
	and exploring the capabilities of such implementations :-)

	Happy Hacking,
